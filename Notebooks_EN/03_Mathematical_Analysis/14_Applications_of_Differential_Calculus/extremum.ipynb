        "\n",
        "In calculus, extremum points refer to the values of a function where the function reaches its highest or lowest points. These are crucial in many optimization problems, such as maximizing profit, minimizing cost, or finding the optimal configuration of a system. To determine extremum points, we use the following methods:\n",

        "\n",
        "## 1. Derivatives and Critical Points\n",
        "\n",
        "To find the extrema (either maxima or minima) of a function, we first need to compute its **first derivative**. The first derivative of a function provides the rate of change or the slope at any point. The primary steps are:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **First Derivative**: For a function $$ f(x) $$, its derivative $$ f'(x) $$ gives us the slope of the tangent at any point on the curve. The formula for the derivative depends on the type of function (e.g., power rule, product rule, quotient rule, chain rule).\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Critical Points**: Critical points occur where the first derivative equals zero, i.e., when $$ f'(x) = 0 $$ or when the first derivative does not exist. These points are potential locations for maxima, minima, or points of inflection.\n",
        "\n",
        "  To find the critical points, solve for $$ x $$ when $$ f'(x) = 0 $$.\n",

        "\n",
        "## 2. Second Derivative Test\n",
        "\n",
        "After finding the critical points, we use the **second derivative test** to determine whether the function has a local maximum, local minimum, or if it's an inflection point.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Second Derivative**: The second derivative, denoted as $$ f''(x) $$, tells us about the concavity of the function:\n",
        "  - If $$ f''(x) > 0 $$ at a critical point, the function is concave up, and we have a **local minimum** at that point.\n",
        "  - If $$ f''(x) < 0 $$ at a critical point, the function is concave down, and we have a **local maximum** at that point.\n",
        "  - If $$ f''(x) = 0 $$, the test is inconclusive, and further analysis (e.g., higher-order derivatives or analyzing the function's behavior near the point) is needed.\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Quadratic Functions**: For functions of the form $$ f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c $$, the critical point can be easily found using the first derivative. The function will always have either a maximum or minimum, and the second derivative helps us classify it as such.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Rational Functions**: For functions of the form $$ f(x) = \\frac{g(x)}{h(x)} $$ (a ratio of two functions), we apply the **quotient rule** to differentiate. Then we solve $$ f'(x) = 0 $$ to find the critical points, and use the second derivative to classify them.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Trigonometric, Exponential, and Logarithmic Functions**: For these types of functions, we apply standard differentiation rules:\n",
        "  - **Trigonometric Functions**: $$ \\frac{d}{dx} (\\sin(x)) = \\cos(x), \\quad \\frac{d}{dx} (\\cos(x)) = -\\sin(x) $$\n",
        "  - **Exponential Functions**: $$ \\frac{d}{dx} (e^x) = e^x $$\n",
