        "## Limits of Real Functions\n",
        "\n",
        "In calculus, **limits** are fundamental in understanding how a function behaves as the input (often denoted as \\( x \\)) approaches a certain value. The limit helps us analyze the behavior of a function near specific points, including at infinity or at points where the function may not be defined.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Concept of Limits**\n",
        "\n",
        "The limit of a function \\( f(x) \\) as \\( x \\) approaches a value \\( a \\), denoted as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\\lim_{x \\to a} f(x)\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "is the value that \\( f(x) \\) approaches as \\( x \\) gets closer to \\( a \\). This means that for any small positive value \\( \\epsilon \\), there exists a small \\( \\delta \\) such that when \\( x \\) is within a distance of \\( \\delta \\) from \\( a \\), \\( f(x) \\) is within a distance of \\( \\epsilon \\) from the limit.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Limits at Infinity**\n",
        "\n",
        "When a function approaches infinity, we are interested in understanding the behavior of the function as \\( x \\) becomes larger and larger. This can be expressed as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x)\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "If the function approaches a finite value, we say it has a **horizontal asymptote**. If the function grows without bound, we say the limit is infinity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{x} = 0\n",
        "$$\n",
        "In this example, as \\( x \\) increases, the value of \\( \\frac{1}{x} \\) becomes closer to 0, indicating that the function has a horizontal asymptote at \\( y = 0 \\).\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **One-Sided Limits**\n",
        "\n",
        "One-sided limits refer to the behavior of the function as \\( x \\) approaches a specific value from either the left (\\( x \\to a^- \\)) or the right (\\( x \\to a^+ \\)). The one-sided limits are important when dealing with functions that may behave differently depending on the direction from which \\( x \\) approaches the point.\n",

        "### 4. **Infinite Limits**\n",
        "\n",
        "An infinite limit occurs when the function increases or decreases without bound as \\( x \\) approaches a certain value. In other words, as \\( x \\) approaches the limit point, the function grows without bound (goes to \\( +\\infty \\) or \\( -\\infty \\)).\n",

        "\n",
        "L'Hopital's Rule is a powerful tool for evaluating limits of indeterminate forms, such as \\( \\frac{0}{0} \\) or \\( \\frac{\\infty}{\\infty} \\). The rule states that if the limit results in an indeterminate form, we can differentiate the numerator and the denominator separately and then take the limit again.\n",

        "\n",
        "Asymptotes are lines that a graph approaches but never touches. There are two main types of asymptotes:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Vertical Asymptotes**: These occur when the function approaches infinity as \\( x \\) approaches a specific value \\( a \\). The function gets closer to \\( \\pm \\infty \\) but never actually reaches that value.\n",

        "\n",
        "To compute limits, we can use various techniques, such as:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Direct Substitution**: Substitute the value of \\( x \\) into the function (if the function is continuous).\n",
        "- **Factorization**: Factor the function and cancel common terms.\n",
        "- **Rationalization**: Multiply by the conjugate to simplify expressions with square roots.\n",
        "- **Use of Special Limits**: Apply known standard limits like \\( \\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{\\sin(x)}{x} = 1 \\) or \\( \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).\n",
