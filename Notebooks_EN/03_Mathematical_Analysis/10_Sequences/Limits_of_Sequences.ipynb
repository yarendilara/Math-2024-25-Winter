        "### 1. Introduction to Differential Equations\n",
        "\n",
        "A differential equation is an equation that involves a function and its derivatives. These equations describe various physical, biological, and economic phenomena by modeling how a quantity changes with respect to another. The primary goal is to find a function that satisfies the given equation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Differential equations are categorized based on their order, linearity, and whether they have constant or variable coefficients.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. First-Order Differential Equations\n",
        "\n",
        "A first-order differential equation involves only the first derivative of the function. These equations often appear in population dynamics, radioactive decay, and cooling processes. A common method for solving first-order differential equations is **separation of variables**.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2.1. Separation of Variables\n",
        "The method of separation of variables is applicable when the equation can be rewritten in the form:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ \\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x) g(y) $$\n",
        "\n",
        "By rewriting and integrating:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ \\int \\frac{dy}{g(y)} = \\int f(x) dx $$\n",
        "\n",
        "we obtain a solution in implicit form, which can often be solved explicitly for \\( y \\).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2.2. Integrating Factor Method\n",
        "For linear first-order equations of the form:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ \\frac{dy}{dx} + P(x)y = Q(x) $$\n",
        "\n",
        "we use an integrating factor:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ \\mu(x) = e^{\\int P(x)dx} $$\n",
        "\n",
        "Multiplying the entire equation by \\( \\mu(x) \\) allows it to be rewritten as an exact differential equation, which can then be integrated to find \\( y(x) \\).\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Second-Order Differential Equations\n",
        "\n",
        "A second-order differential equation involves the second derivative of the function. These equations frequently appear in mechanics, wave motion, and electrical circuits.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3.1. Characteristic Equation Approach\n",
        "For linear equations with constant coefficients:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ a y'' + b y' + c y = 0 $$\n",
        "\n",
        "we assume a solution of the form:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ y = e^{rx} $$\n",
        "\n",
        "Substituting into the equation gives a characteristic equation:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ ar^2 + br + c = 0 $$\n",
        "\n",
        "Solving for \\( r \\) provides the general solution, which can involve real or complex exponentials depending on the nature of the roots.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3.2. Homogeneous and Particular Solutions\n",
        "For inhomogeneous equations:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ y'' + ay' + by = f(x) $$\n",
        "\n",
        "we find the **complementary solution** (solving the homogeneous part) and a **particular solution** using methods like **undetermined coefficients** or **variation of parameters**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Second-Order Partial Differential Equations\n",
        "\n",
        "Partial differential equations (PDEs) involve multiple independent variables. A fundamental PDE is the **wave equation**:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} - v^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} = 0 $$\n",
        "\n",
        "Solutions to the wave equation take the form:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ u(x,t) = A \\cos(\\omega t + kx) $$\n",
        "\n",
        "where \\( \\omega \\) and \\( k \\) relate to the wave speed and frequency.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. Limits of Sequences\n",
        "\n",
        "A sequence is a function whose domain is the set of natural numbers. The **limit of a sequence** represents the value that the terms of the sequence approach as the index increases indefinitely.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 5.1. Evaluating Limits of Sequences\n",
        "\n",
        "A common technique to evaluate limits of rational sequences involves dividing the numerator and denominator by the highest power of \\( n \\). For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{n^2 + 3n}{2 n^2 - 2n} $$\n",
        "\n",
        "Dividing by \\( n^2 \\):\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1 + \\frac{3}{n}}{2 - \\frac{2}{n}} = \\frac{1 + 0}{2 - 0} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\n",
        "\n",
        "Similarly, for sequences involving cubic terms:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{(2n+3)^3}{n^3-1} $$\n",
        "\n",
        "Expanding and simplifying yields the limit.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 5.2. The Squeeze Theorem\n",
        "\n",
        "The **Squeeze Theorem** states that if a sequence \\( a_n \\) is squeezed between two other sequences that converge to the same limit, then \\( a_n \\) must also converge to that limit. This is particularly useful for oscillatory sequences like:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\sin(n)}{n} $$\n",
        "\n",
        "Since \\( -1 \\leq \\sin(n) \\leq 1 \\), dividing by \\( n \\) and applying the squeeze theorem shows that the limit is \\( 0 \\).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 5.3. Exponential Sequences\n",
        "\n",
        "An important limit is:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ a_n = \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{n}\\right)^n $$\n",
        "\n",
        "Taking the natural logarithm and applying L'HÃ´pital's Rule proves that:\n",
