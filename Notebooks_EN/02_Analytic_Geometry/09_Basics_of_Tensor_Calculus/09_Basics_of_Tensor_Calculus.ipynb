        "\n",
        "Tensor calculus is a mathematical framework used for analyzing and manipulating geometrical and physical objects that are more complex than scalars and vectors. It extends the concept of vectors to higher dimensions and involves **tensor fields** that describe quantities in a multi-dimensional space. Tensors can represent various physical quantities, such as stress, energy, and curvature in physics and engineering, especially in the fields of general relativity and continuum mechanics.\n",
