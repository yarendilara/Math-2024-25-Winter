## Types of Line Equations in the Plane

### General Equation of a Line
The general form of a line equation in two dimensions is given as:
\[
Ax + By + C = 0,
\]
where:
- \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) are constants,
- \(x\) and \(y\) are variables.

### Canonical Equation of a Line
The canonical form simplifies the line equation by considering its slope and intercepts:
\[
y = mx + b,
\]
where:
- \(m\) is the slope,
- \(b\) is the \(y\)-intercept.

### Line Equation in Intercept Form
If a line intersects the \(x\)-axis at \((a, 0)\) and the \(y\)-axis at \((0, b)\), its equation can be written as:
\[
\frac{x}{a} + \frac{y}{b} = 1.
\]

### Line Equation in Slope Form
The slope-intercept form is:
\[
y - y_1 = m(x - x_1),
\]
where \((x_1, y_1)\) is a point on the line and \(m\) is the slope.

### Line Equation Passing Through Two Points
If a line passes through points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\), its equation is given by:
\[
\frac{y - y_1}{y_2 - y_1} = \frac{x - x_1}{x_2 - x_1}.
\]

## Relative Positions of Lines in the Plane

### Intersection of Two Lines
For two lines:
\[
A_1x + B_1y + C_1 = 0
\]
and
\[
A_2x + B_2y + C_2 = 0,
\]
we solve their simultaneous equations to find the intersection point.

### Angle Between Two Lines
The angle \(\theta\) between two lines with slopes \(m_1\) and \(m_2\) is:
\[
\tan \theta = \left| \frac{m_2 - m_1}{1 + m_1m_2} \right|.
\]

### Conditions for Parallelism and Perpendicularity
- Two lines are **parallel** if \(m_1 = m_2\).
- Two lines are **perpendicular** if \(m_1m_2 = -1\).
